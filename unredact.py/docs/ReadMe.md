# PDF Redaction Auditor (Unredactor)
This script is designed to process PDF files to relveal what's under weak redaction methods by recoloring digital text and selectively removing black redaction boxes.   
It works by creating a new document and re-inserting only the essential elements from the original.  

## Features
* **Text Recovery:** Extracts underlying digital text that might be hidden beneath redaction layers.  
* **Smart Box Removal:** Detects images that appear to be black redaction boxes (based on brightness) and allows for their removal.  
* **Highlighting:** Option to turn recovered text red to make it easily identifiable.  
* **Batch Processing:** Supports individual files or entire directories.
